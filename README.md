<h1>What is the relationship between annual leave taken and bonus?</h1>

In this section I sought to address and provide observations on the relationship between the amount of leave taken and bonuses received by employees.<br>

<h2>Observations:</h2> 

We can see from the visualization on the slide, the relationship between annual leave taken and bonuses received by employees is best described as a ‘weak positive’ relation. 
 
The general trajectory is slightly upwards, thereby denoting a degree of relation between leave taken and bonus received.

When we take averages into account, the average annual leave is around 29 hours of leave taken, 8 employees have taken leave above this average, with 5 out of the 8 employees receiving higher bonuses too. This therefore implies some connection. 
 
When we look at the 4 points that sit much lower on both plots in terms of bonuses, you’ll notice that they have also received fewer bonuses in comparison to the rest. 3 out of those 4 data points are non-sales staff and one is sales staff who could be considered an outlier in terms of leave/bonus.

Finally, and briefly, when also considering Sick leave and annual leave, the relation here is best described as positive with the hours lining up closely. It is fair to infer here that sick leave plays little to no observable role in impacting whether staff receive more bonuses or not. 
 
<h2>Summary:</h2>
 
There is some relation in terms of the amount of leave taken and bonuses received by staff, however, this relation isn’t a very strong one because all employees work between 20 – 40 hours, yet there exists a wide distribution in the amounts of bonuses received among employees.

<h1>Relationship between store size, number of employees and revenue?</h1>

In this section I analysed the nature of the relationship between the following variables - store size, number of employees and revenue generated.<br>

<h2>Observations:</h2> 

As the size of the store increases, so does its annual revenue. This suggests that larger stores tend to generate more revenue. 

Additionally, the colour gradient on the bars, which represents the number of employees, indicates that stores with more employees (darker/red bars) tend to be larger and have higher annual revenue. 

This could imply that having more employees contributes to higher revenue, possibly due to increased operational capacity or customer service. 

However, this is just a correlation and may not necessarily imply causation. 

Other factors not shown on the graph could also be influencing these results (seasonal shopping habits, changes in the tax rate and existing business strategy utilisation).
